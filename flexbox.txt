Flex Box

display : flex 

style the items when the flex container is styled

if flex-direction : row
main axis - horizontal 
cross axis - vertical

if flex-direction : column
main axis - vertical 
cross axis - horizontal

if we want to style 

main axis => justify-content : flex-start, center, space-between, space-around
cross axis => align-item : stretch(discards the size), flex-start(keep the size), center


align-content is only for multiline flex box containers => for example if flex-wrap:wrap

flex-wrap : wrap;
align-content:flex-start,flex-end,center,space-between,space-around;



Flex box items property
flex-shrink:0; // to make the item not shrink
flex-grow:1 // item take all the extra space-around -> they grow proportionately

if width is set -> flex grow takes the available empty spaces and add to width in the proportion set by flex-grow , if this needs to be over-written use flex-bssis
flex-basis : 0 // consider it growing from 0 px




align-self => over-rides the cross axis alignment of the item

align-self : center,flex-end

order: 3 changes the order of the container without changing in HTML



we need container and the items -> flex-wrap for the responsiveness


This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined

The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional.

default : 0 1 auto

It is recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the individual properties

 flex: 1 // all the flexible items be the same length, regardless of its content
