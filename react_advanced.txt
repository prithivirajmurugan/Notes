this -> reference to the object executing the current function

// if method --> reference the object to which the method belongs to

// if a function --> global (window in browser,global in nodejs)


// if a constructor function

function Video(title){
this.title = title;
console.log(this)
}

const v = new Video('b') // this references to the new object

const video = {
	title:'a',
	tags:['a','b','c'],
	showTags(){
		this.tags.forEach(function(tag){
			console.log(this,tag);
		},this);
	}
}



Bind -> Binding an object to a function and so that we use that object using 'this'


let c1 = {
	x:5,
	y:10
}

let c2={
	x:75,
	y:235,
}

function printCoordinates(){
	console.log(this.x + ',' + this.y);
}

let c1_func = printCoordinates.bind(c1);
let c2_func = printCoordinates.bind(c2);



array.flat() // input parameter deep by default is 1


infiniteDeep.flat(Infinity)

function flatArray(arr){
	let result;
	let main=arr,first;
	while(main.length>0){
		first = main[0]
		if(Array.isArray(first)){
			Array.prototype.splice.apply(main,[0,1].concat(first));
		}else{
			result.push(first);
			main.splice(0,1);
		}
	}
	return result;
}


function flatten(arr) {
  let flat = []
  for (let i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const cur = arr[i]
    if(!Array.isArray(cur)){
      flat.push(cur)
    }else{
      for (let j=0; j < cur.length; j++) {
        flat.push(cur[j])
      }
    }
  }
  return flat
}

console.log(flatten([['foo','bar'],['baz','qux']]))
console.log(flatten([[1],[2],3,4,[5]]))
console.log(flatten([false,[true,[false]],[true]]))
console.log(flatten([]))

var i in arr ==> iterates over keys -> works with even objects
var i of arr ==> iterates over values -> works only with arrays

numbers.forEach(myFunction);
function myFunction(value,index,array){
}

new Set([]) // to create a new set


Prototypcal inheritence

every class has a prototype properities to which we can methods and attributes // the original class will not have this property

but the object created with help of the class will have the method added

function Grizzly(){
	Bear.call(this);
}
Grizzly.prototype = Object.create(Bear.prototype);

prototype chaining if the object does not have the method then it will the prototype


arr.__proto__

Object.prototype => base prototype of the arr.__proto__

object.__proto__.__proto__ == null

call method ==> function borrowing

let printFullName = function(){
	console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
}
name.printFullName.call(name2);

printFullName.call(name2) or printFullName.call(name1)

printFullName.call(name,"Dehradun","Maharashtra");
printFullName.apply(name,["Dehradun","Maharashtra"]);

let printMyName  = printFullName.bind(name2,"Mumbai","Maharashtra");



Function.prototype.mybind = function(..args){
	let obj = this
	params = args.slice(1);
	return function(..args2){
		new_params = [...params,...args2]
		obj.apply(args[0],new_params)
	}
}

Local Storage:
1. read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object,
2. across browser sessions
3. localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends or page is closed
4. localStorage.setItem(key, value)
5. localStorage.getItem(key)
6. localStorage.removeItem(key)
7. localStorage.clear()
8. Browser Only
9. 10mb
10. js can access it and it should be sent by us (not automatically sent as like cookies)

Session Storage:
1. Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property
2. localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends
3. 5mb
4. Same tab
5. 

Cookies:
1. Managed by Browser and Server
2. 4 Kb
3. Any window
4. Sent with requests
5. document.cookie='name=Kyle;expire=' + new Date().toUTCString()
6. res.cookie('grass','green',{httpOnly:true,secure:true,maxAge:12000}) // to restrict client side to access the cookie
7. web browser automatically sends the cookie back to the web-browser everytime it sends a request
8. npm install cookie-parser
9. CSRF --> Cross Side Request Forgery --> since cookie are automatically send to every request another site can simply post
10. npm install csurf -> encode csurf in your html to prevent it
11. can be used with jwt


Session-with-db:
1. Session id is sent to the server , server stores the id and the value related to the value
2. npm install express-session
3. req.session.user
4. session data use store as a database
5. session id is stored in cookie of browser, which is checked with the database to find the user
6. can be used in terms of browser

JWT
1.platform agnostic , no need browser to check
2.every login sends a token, 
3.server will not store any data
4. jwt.sign({some_property:"some_value"},jwtsecret) // jwt secret should be in .env file
5. jwt.verify(req.body.token,jwtsecret,function(err,decoded){})
6. front-end can store the jwt in localstorage and send to server whenever it is needed.
7. downside of jwt is that person can get hold of jwt token and use it any browser but it cannot be done in terms of session storage when tab is closed.

Object cloning
1. {...food} // shallow copy (first level is copied)
2. Object.assign({},food}
3. JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(food)) //deep copy at all levels

Reconciliation is the algorithm behind Virtual DOM --> difference in the current tree and the work-in progress tree is flashed to the rendering environment
the operation are prioritized before rendered

Web and React-Native rendering

heuristic algorithm --> find approximate solution (assumption)

New type --> New tree
New Key --> New Key


How react worked internally?

1. most expensive thing I can do to a web browser, is to write in a DOM
2. DOM API edits the HTML document
3. react creates an instance of the component, instance consumes its props it deduces state and returns the element (plain object, not HTML)
4. Reconciliation -> diff the tree of virtualDOM and updating the difference part using heruistic, creates and destroying DOM elements
5. type of children component changes the DOM destroyed and recreated
6. Key is important because if new element is updated to the beginning of the list, then the whole list will be re-generated again.
7. Fewer DOM manipulation possible should be the key
8. index may or may not be changed, so do not use index as key
9. ReactDOM.render --> rendering process,generates virtual DOM, generates Tree of elements and inserts it to the DOM
10. React --> only does the diffing process
11. React Fiber --> provides non-blocking renders, does the insertion into DOM, possibility of dynamically imports

const MyComponent = (<main><h1 id="title">Look ma!!! </h1></main>)
console.log(MyComponent) // provides virtual DOM


Context API:
The Context API can be used to share data with multiple components, without having to pass data through props manually.

const NotesContext = createContext([]);

<NotesContext.Provider> and <NotesContext.Consumer>


Provider --> The Provider component is going to be used to wrap the components that are going to have access to our context.

<NotesContext.Provider value={this.state.notes}>
...
</Notes.Provider>

Consumer:

The Consumer component allows a React component to subscribe to the context changes. The component makes the data available using a render prop.

<NotesContext.Consumer>
  {values => <h1>{value}</h1>
</Notes.Consumer>

const notes = useContext(NotesContext);



Debouncing and Throttling --> limit the rate of function call



Debouncing method in js

any event will restart the timer and will wait for 300 ms to call the function

attached function will be executed only after the specified time once the user stops firing the event.

function debounce(func,timeout=300){
	let timer;
	return (...args)=>{
		clearTimeout(timer);
		timer = setTimeout(()=>{func.apply(this,args);},timeout);
};
}
}

function saveInput(){
	console.log('Saving Data');
}
const processChange =  debounce(()=> saveInput());

Throttling method in js

if the difference between two function call is 300ms then function get executed

Throttling ensures that the function executes at a regular interval

function throttleFunction = function(func,delay){
	if(timerId){
		return
	}
	timerId = setTimeout(()=>{func(),timerId=undefined},delay)
}

Event Bubbling 

When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.

Almost all events bubble , but some may not like focus event

event.target --> contains the element which initiated the bubbling process

this or event.currentTarget --> current element, the one that has a currently running handler on it

event.stopPropagation() --> calling this at handler stops the propagation , stops upwards but other handlers in same element will running

event.stopImmediatePropagation() --> no other handlers executed

No real need to prevent bubbling



Capturing aka trickling

Three phases of event propagation:
1. Capturing phase - event goes down to the element
2. Target phase - event reached the target element
3. Bubbling phase - event bubbles up from the element

Hoisting


Currying



The RunTime

    1. JS Engine
    2. Web API
    3. Callback Queue or message queue
    4. Event Table
    5. Event loop
	
single threaded hence single call stack, each entry in call stack is called a  stack frame


React 18 - 5 New Hooks

import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(rootElement);
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();


useTransition() -- hook for transition -- returns the transition state and a function to start the transition

const [isPending,startTransition] = useTransition();

React state updates are classified into two categories:

   1.Urgent updates — They reflect direct interaction, such as typing, clicking, pressing, dragging, etc.
   2.Transition updates — They transition the UI from one view to another.
   
   
import { useEffect, useState, useTransition } from 'react';

const SlowUI = ({ value }) => (
  <>
    {Array(value)
      .fill(1)
      .map((_, index) => (
        <span key={index}>{value - index} </span>
      ))}
  </>
);

function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
  const [value2, setValue2] = useState(100000);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const handleClick = () => {
    setValue(value + 1);
    startTransition(() => setValue2(value2 + 1));
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>{value}</button>
      <div
        style={{
          opacity: isPending ? 0.5 : 1,
        }}
      >
        <SlowUI value={value2} />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;


useDeferredValue
useDeferredValue(value) is hook that accepts a value and 
returns a new copy of the value that will defer to more urgent updates. 
The previous value is kept until urgent updates have completed. Then, the new value is rendered. This hook is similar to using debouncing or throttling to defer updates.

import { useDeferredValue, useState } from 'react';

const SlowUI = () => (
  <>
    {Array(50000)
      .fill(1)
      .map((_, index) => (
        <span key={index}>{100000} </span>
      ))}
  </>
);

function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
  const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setValue(value + 1);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>{value}</button>
      <div>DeferredValue: {deferredValue}</div>
      <div>
        <SlowUI />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;

useId:

useId() is a hook that generates a unique id:

1. This id is stable across the server and client, 
which avoids hydration mismatches for server-side rendering.
2. This id is unique for the entire application. 
In the case of multi-root applications, hydrateRoot has an optional prop, identifierPrefix, 
which can be used to add a prefix to prevent collisions.
3. This id can be appended with prefix and/or suffix to generate multiple unique ids that are used in a component.
It seems trivial. But, useId was evolved from useOpaqueIdentifier, 
which generates an opaque id that cannot be operated upon.

useSyncExternalStore:

useSyncExternalStore is a hook recommended for reading and subscribing from external data sources (stores).

const state = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot[, getServerSnapshot]);

1. subscribe: It is a function to register a callback that is called whenever the store changes.
2. getSnapshot: It is function that returns the current value of the store.
3. getServerSnapshot: It is function that returns the snapshot used during server rendering. This is an optional parameter.

import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';

function App() {
  const width = useSyncExternalStore(
    (listener) => {
      window.addEventListener('resize', listener);
      return () => {
        window.removeEventListener('resize', listener);
      };
    },
    () => window.innerWidth
    // () => -1,
  );

  return <p>Size: {width}</p>;
}

export default App;


useInsertionEffect

useEffect(didUpdate) accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code, which are mutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects. By default, effects run after every completed render, but the invocation can be controlled with a second argument of an array.

useLayoutEffect has the same signature as useEffect, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. i.e. it is fired before useEffect. It is used to read layout from the DOM and synchronously re-render. Updates scheduled inside useLayoutEffect will be flushed synchronously, before the browser has a chance to paint.

useInsertionEffect is introduced in React 18. It has the same signature as useEffect, but it fires synchronously before all DOM mutations. i.e. it is fired before useLayoutEffect. It is used to inject styles into the DOM before reading layout.

useInsertionEffect is intended for CSS-in-JS libraries, such as styled-components. Since this hook is limited in scope, this hook does not have access to refs and cannot schedule updates.

import { useEffect, useInsertionEffect, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';

const Child = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('useEffect child is called');
  });
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    console.log('useLayoutEffect child is called');
  });
  useInsertionEffect(() => {
    console.log('useInsertionEffect child is called');
  });
};

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('useEffect app is called');
  });
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    console.log('useLayoutEffect app is called');
  });
  useInsertionEffect(() => {
    console.log('useInsertionEffect app is called');
  });
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Child />
      <p>Random Text</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
